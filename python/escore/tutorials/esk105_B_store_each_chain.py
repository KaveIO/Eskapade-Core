The global flag settings['storeResultsEachChain'] (default = False)
controls persistence of the run-process services after the execution of
a chain.  By default, these objects are only stored after the last
chain.

From the command line, this flag is set with option --store-all.
Alternatively, the option --store-one="chain_name" can be used to store
the results of a single chain.  The with the option --store-none, no
results are stored.
