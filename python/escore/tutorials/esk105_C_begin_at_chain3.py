By default, the process manager starts the execution of the first
configured chain and end with the last one.  If the run-process services
are written out after the execution of each chain (--store-all), it is
possible to execute one particular chain.  This is done by picking up
the services written out by the previous chain.  This is a nice feature
for debugging and developing purposes.

From the command line use the options:

-b BEGIN_WITH_CHAIN
-e END_WITH_CHAIN
-s SINGLE_CHAIN
